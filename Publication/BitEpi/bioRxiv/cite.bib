	abstract = {Motivation: Higher-order epistatic interactions can be the driver for complex genetic diseases. An exhaustive search is the most accurate method for identifying interactive SNPs. While there is a fast bitwise algorithm for pairwise exhaustive searching (BOOST), higher-order exhaustive searching has yet to be efficiently optimized. Results: In this paper, we introduce BitEpi, a program to detect and visualize higher-order epistatic interactions using an exhaustive search. BitEpi introduces a novel bitwise algorithm that can perform higher-order analysis more quickly and is the first bitwise algorithm to search for 4-SNP interactions. Furthermore, BitEpi increases detection accuracy by using a novel entropy-based power analysis. BitEpi visualizes significant interactions in a publication-ready interactive graph. BitEpi is 56 times faster than MDR for 4-SNP searching and is up to 1.33 and 2.09 times more accurate than BOOST and MPI3SNP respectively.},
